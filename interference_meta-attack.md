## Disabling Network Hardware##

Attack Pattern

"Disabling Internet access is an extreme form of Internet censor- ship in which a populationâ€™s Internet access is blocked completely, a coarse but technically more straightforward approach than the selective blocking used in most Internet censorship regimes. It can be implemented by simply powering down or physically disconnecting critical equipment, although this approach typically requires physical co-location with the communications equipment, which may be spread over a wide area"

### DNS Domain Removal###

Detailed Attack Pattern

*Is this worth including? It requires the adversary to actually have the root name server remove the domain against a services will.*

### BGP Routing Disruption###

Detailed Attack Pattern

"Disabling the routing process on critical routers or suppressing BGP information transmission can
effectively render large parts of a network unreachable."

### DNS Filtering###

Detailed Attack Pattern

When DNS requests for a specific domain are dropped by an in-path server.

*Is this common enough to include? I have only really heard of DNS blocking that uses redirection being used in the wild.*

* Mitigations
  * Hard Coded Alternate DNS server in applications
  * don't depend on DNS
  * include "hosts file"/IP address in your app
  * Use a .onion domain with Tor support

## Data Filtering##

Attack Pattern

When a specific type of data is dropped by an in-path server. When requests are filtered the corresponding connections time out.

* Resources Required
  * in-path router

* Methods of attack
  * Filter Request

"The first opportunity for this arises during the TCP connection establishment phase.  However, since hostnames are not available in TCP SYN packets, the black- list for such filtering would consist of IP addresses, port and protocol combinations. The next opportunity for filtering requests arises when HTTP requests are made. The blacklist for such filtering can consist of a combination of domain, sub-domain, or hostnames and even regular expressions focusing on URLs and keywords. When requests are filtered, corresponding connections time out and the browser dis- plays an error stating this to the end user.  Likewise, since the request never reaches the destination web server, it can- not even infer that censorship is occurring." [1]

  * Filter Response

"As the dual to filtering the request, a censor may filter on response, either instead of filtering requests or in addition.  Response-based filtering can only be keyword based, however, as the host- name and page requested are not included in an HTTP response" [1]
