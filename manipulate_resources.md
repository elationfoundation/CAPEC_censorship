### [Wi-Fi Jamming](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/604.html) (604)

Detailed Attack Pattern

In this attack scenario, the attacker actively transmits on the Wi-Fi channel to prevent users from transmitting or receiving data from the targeted Wi-Fi network. There are several known techniques to perform this attack â€“ for example: the attacker may flood the Wi-Fi access point (e.g. the retransmission device) with deauthentication frames. Another method is to transmit high levels of noise on the RF band used by the Wi-Fi network.

### [Cellular Jamming](http://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/605.html) (605)

Detailed Attack Pattern

In this attack scenario, the attacker actively transmits signals to overpower and disrupt the communication between a cellular user device and a cell tower. Several existing techniques are known in the open literature for this attack for 2G, 3G, and 4G LTE cellular technology. For example, some attacks target cell towers by overwhelming them with false status messages, while others introduce high levels of noise on signaling channels.

### Disabling Network Hardware

Detailed Attack Pattern

"Disabling Internet access is an extreme form of Internet censor- ship in which a populationâ€™s Internet access is blocked completely, a coarse but technically more straightforward approach than the selective blocking used in most Internet censorship regimes. It can be implemented by simply powering down or physically disconnecting critical equipment, although this approach typically requires physical co-location with the communications equipment, which may be spread over a wide area"

  * BGP Router

Observables:  "Disabling a networkâ€™s connectivity to the Internet through BGP routing disruption is easily detectable, since it entails changes in the global routing state of the network, i.e., in the control plane. Previously advertised prefixes must be withdrawn or re-advertised with different properties in order to change global routing behavior." - [2]
